## Overview

Browsing Frontend Mentor as a Newbie I came accross this challenge. I have completed it with HTML and CSS only. I used the free plan and do not have access to the Figma Design files. So I did my best estimations to recreate the page.

## My process

I used Adobe Photoshop to try and estimate the distance between elements. I broke it down one element at a time. I also followed the boilerplate/global css framework that Jessica from they Coder Coder YouTube channel uses.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first challenge and I learned a lot about using css and trying to position elements where I wanted them and sizing them appropriately. There was a lot of trial and error as this was my firt time actually using VS Code and Github.

### Continued development

I would like to focus on learning CSS Grid. I think it has a lot of potential for layouts and if I can master it, a whole new world will open up to me.
I would also like to work on learning how to effectively use CSS Custom properties and using the cascade.

### Useful resources
